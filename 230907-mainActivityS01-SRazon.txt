Good day, my name is Sean Dominic Acal Razon.

I used to play sports such as baseball, badminton, and football/soccer. I started of listening to rock music when I was a kid, and I transitioned to hip-hop when I got older. I don't have a favorite band/artist because I enjoy them all equally. My favorite movie is Monty Python and the Holy Grail. A British comedy film that parodies the legend of King Arthur's quest for the Holy Grail.
